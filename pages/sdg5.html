          Gender equality is essential for sustainable development, as it
          benefits societies, economies, and communities as a whole. This goal
          aims to eliminate discrimination and violence against all individuals,
          promoting equal opportunities in leadership, education, and economic
          participation, regardless of gender identity. By fostering an
          inclusive environment, we can create a society where everyone has the
          chance to thrive. Urdaneta City University actively champions gender
          equality and empowerment for all through initiatives that promote
          diverse leadership within the student body and faculty. The University
          organizes events and workshops that address a wide range of gender
          issues, creating safe spaces for open dialogue and discussion. By
          empowering students to advocate for equal rights and opportunities,
          UCU fosters an inclusive community where all individuals are
          encouraged to contribute to positive change. Through mentorship
          programs and support networks, UCU ensures that every student,
          regardless of gender, can pursue their aspirations and lead with
          confidence.

          Urdaneta City University Tracks Women’s Application and Admission

            <p>
              Urdaneta City, Philippines — Urdaneta City University (UCU) has
              implemented a systematic approach to track and analyze women’s
              application and acceptance rates in admissions. This initiative,
              led by UCU’s Admissions department, gathers demographic data to
              evaluate gender equity and drive data-informed policies for a more
              inclusive student body.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allows UCU to collect real-time data on the percentage of
              female applicants and their acceptance rates, providing valuable
              insights into gender representation within the student body. By
              monitoring these metrics, UCU can make informed decisions to
              enhance outreach and support efforts that encourage more women to
              apply and thrive at the university. “At UCU, we aim to create an
              environment where every student, regardless of gender, has equal
              access to education and opportunities.

              Urdaneta City, Philippines — Urdaneta City University (UCU) has
              launched a new initiative focused on promoting gender equity and
              inclusion by establishing comprehensive guidelines and policies
              aimed at supporting women’s applications, admissions, and overall
              participation within the university. This strategic move is part
              of UCU’s broader commitment to fostering an inclusive academic
              environment where every student has the opportunity to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recognizing the importance of gender diversity in higher
              education, UCU’s administration has developed a set of policies
              specifically addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by
              women in pursuing academic and professional growth. These
              guidelines outline fair admissions processes, support networks,
              and pathways for women’s success, contributing to a balanced
              student body that reflects UCU’s commitment to gender equity.

              Urdaneta City, Philippines — Urdaneta City University (UCU) has
              launched a new campaign last May 9, 2022 to actively encourage
              more women to apply to programs where they are traditionally
              underrepresented, such as criminology, engineering, information
              technology, and certain areas within the sciences. This initiative
              reflects UCU’s commitment to promoting diversity in all fields of
              study and supporting women in exploring a wider range of academic
              and career opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              UCU’s campaign to increase women’s enrollment in underrepresented
              fields represents a forwardthinking approach to education. By
              challenging gender norms in academia and encouraging more women to
              pursue diverse fields, UCU is not only enriching its own academic
              community but also preparing a new generation of women to lead and
              innovate in their chosen professions. As the university continues
              to expand this initiative, it hopes to inspire lasting change and
              serve as a model for other institutions aiming to achieve greater
              gender diversity in higher education.

              With the introduction of this policy, UCU is not only ensuring
              that women are afforded equal rights within the university but
              also setting a precedent for other academic institutions to
              follow. The university is committed to continuously reviewing and
              updating its practices to maintain an environment that is both
              supportive and inclusive of all genders.
